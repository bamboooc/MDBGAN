1.requirements

Pytorch == 1.7.1

To run the code, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX3080 GPU video card with 10GB video memory is required. 

Software development environment should be any Python integrated development environment used on an NVIDIA video card. 

Programming language: Python 3.6.12. 

2.How to use？


Set the network parameters such as niter, learning rate and storage location.  After configuring the parameters and environment, you can run main_train.py directly for 2D simulations, and the same for 3D simulations.
